This data shows the year and the amount of people that were unemployed. It also shows the perecentage of the population in Los Angeles and gives the average age of the amount of people unemployed. If used productively, it can be used to track unemployment rate and used for an ability to not reach that rate anymore. It can also target the age range to supply them with jobs.  "
